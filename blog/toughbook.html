My daily laptop is a 2011 Pansonic Toughbook. I received this laptop as a gift from a company I worked with
during college in eastern Washington, innov8.ag. We used a variety of ruggedized gear like this, and specifically toughbooks for data collection via GreenAtlas and SoilOptix; the latter would ship Toughbooks as part of the
product. This one isa  first generation, with a second generation core CPU and 8G RAM when I came into it.
It had a driver incompatibility with newer versions of Windows, and after spending about a week troubleshooting i,
we decided it was better offloaded onto me.
The Toughbook CF-31 is water and shock resistant. Its a fairly modular design, with isolated containers for the
drives and battery. The main drive bay accepts an actively heated drive caddy with foam shock absorbers. This
is great for a number of reasons: in extreme cold, the miniscule moving parts on which spinning platter media
rely can leave spec and become brittle; removing a SATA drive in a dusty or damp environment is safer when it's in
a metal case like this; even dropping the laptop is safer given the drive is so well insulated.
It has a 1200 nit display, which is just staggeringly bright. Once I turned the brightness all the way up after using it on the minimum for a whole evening, just to see what it was like, and I was in pain for a few minutes afterward.
