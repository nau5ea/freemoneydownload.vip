My daily laptop is a 2011 Pansonic Toughbook. I received this laptop as a gift from a company I worked with
during college in eastern Washington, innov8.ag. We used a variety of ruggedized gear like this, and specifically toughbooks for data collection via GreenAtlas and SoilOptix; the latter would ship Toughbooks as part of the
product. This one isa  first generation, with a second generation core CPU and 8G RAM when I came into it.
It had a driver incompatibility with newer versions of Windows, and after spending about a week troubleshooting i,
we decided it was better offloaded onto me.
The Toughbook CF-31 is water and shock resistant. Its a fairly modular design, with isolated containers for the
drives and battery. The main drive bay accepts an actively heated drive caddy with foam shock absorbers. This
is great for a number of reasons: in extreme cold, the miniscule moving parts on which spinning platter media
rely can leave spec and become brittle; removing a SATA drive in a dusty or damp environment is safer when it's in
a metal case like this; even dropping the laptop is safer given the drive is so well insulated.
It has a 1200 nit display, which is just staggeringly bright. Once I turned the brightness all the way up after using it on the minimum for a whole evening, just to see what it was like, and I was in pain for a few minutes afterward.

My stupidity aside, the Toughbook is a great daily laptop. I used it through two years of computer science coursework, it has like 10 hours of battery life, which is more than I could ever reaonably use without having access to a charger, and the batteries are cheap and trivial to swap. (They're behind a spring loaded door and they slide in with a really satisfying thunkiness). The laptop is pretty heavy. Actually it's really heavy, especially to people who are used to carrying around a macbook as thick as a piece of cardstock, but it comes with a carry handle that makes it ergonomically much more tolerable. And in exchange for the weight you get a lot of durability. My dad's 2012 macbook pros, the two of them, each have giant dents in the corners that make it tenuous to plug in a network cable, but this thing has been dropped in dirt, onto concrete and off of platforms and its in the same shape as it was from the factory.

I have had two recurring problems with the CF-31, one long lasting and one that's only come up in the last year.
The first is that the touchscreen is not supported on my distribution. Void is small and doesn't come with every driver and HCI layer out of the box, so while the CF-31 touchscreen is known compatible with Linux broadly and "just works" on Ubuntu, the many hours I've spent trying to figure out what's missing on Void have never paid off. I just run it disabled in BIOS now.
The second is that the backlit keyboard mine is speced with is not serviceable. I reached out to Bob Johnson's last year because something had gotten under the comma key on my machine and it was really annoying to have to press the key extra hard, it reduced my WPM a lot and also felt bad. The guy on the other end, who was great to talk to, broke the news that if you pull a key off you really can't get it back on. You have to just replace the whole board.

The CF-31 was one of the first laptops to use chiclet keys, and Bob Johnson's claims that the alternate keyboard specs were either a mechanical version or an all-rubber one for extreme waterproofing needs. The first point is not really accurate; the "standard" option keyboard for the CF-31 that has no backlight is still a membrane board, but it's the better style of membrane board like that on retro Thinkpads.

I don't really use the backlight on the board, plus the screen is so damn bright that it makes bedside lamps redundant, so I will most likely buy a parts machine and pull the "mechanical" board from it.

Shortly before I made that decision, I also installed an extra 8GB RAM stick from my W540, because I hardly use that thing anymore and I still use my Toughbook almost daily.
