my thinkpad was my first real adult computer. it was the first machine i bought entirely. i dont remember what initially interested me in thinkpads - it may have been the vintage computing youtube scene.
i way overpaid for it at around $400 US. these things rarely crack $250 these days. This is because they're considered a major misstep in the history of Thinkpad design.
 The W540's fatal flaws are double: its awful display and its "clunkpad" mouse. Lenovo decided to pivot away from the
 classical Thinkpad trackpad with this machine, and they substituted the top triple button pattern for a single button,
 integral trackpad. this means the user has to move the entire trackpad to use any of the three mouse buttons, and that entails overcoming a lot more spring pressure and feeling a lot of weight reciprocation. The W541 was released soon after the 540 launched with a conventional trackpad as a response to the overwhelmingly negative reception of this component.

 I never had a problem with the action of the clunkpad. its different, and im sure if it hadnt been my first machine i would have other feelings about it. but i do have reliability problems with this component under linux. sometimes the scroll button breaks and gives no result, for no clear reason. it does seem to be associated with disuse of the trackpad in favor of the trackpoint.

 i got the 540 with the quad core i7 and i was running 24g of ram for a long time. it was my daily workstation in college and i ran void with dwm on it for that whole time. i also used it to run fortnite on a different windows disk and a couple fallout games with proton. it kind of chugged but it was good enough. i also ran a lot of minecraft on it which was quite cozy.
 i'v never run an NVME drive in it although I think that's possible. it just always got so hot it felt like it was throttled by airflow/thermal capacity far before it was throttled by disk.
