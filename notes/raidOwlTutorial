arch: host on local box and use cloudflare and nginx proxy and nginx html server
nginx holds the ssl cert
also nginx proxy man is running in docker, nginx web server is running on machine

right now nginx web server is running. i looked at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf and it says its listening at port 8080 and 8000, but i cant access those ports from my tower or via links on the server
